        <p>
          Co-Founder of the music center. He plays Piano and the organ since he can think. 
          While studying physics, he never stopped composing sonatas and other pieces for the piano. After a while, he met 
          somebody who shares the same interest. So, the Idea of SCHALLPLATTE was born. Now, Max manages all events of this center 
          as well as our new project, the online forum.

          Co-Founder of the music center. Just like Max, he plays every day. However, the instrument that stole his heart 
          is the violine. He uses to say that he would have become a musician if he wasn't a physicist. Albert takes care of
          all the business related work. Also, he is giving violine lessons.

          <p>
            Albert and Max one day met for a coffee talking about music. The idea emerged that they wanted to build place
            where musicians can meet up and share their interest and devotion for music. Practicing instruments, meet the 
            peer group. Share excitement for own compositions. They decided to make the first move.

          <h5>Milestone 2: the purchase</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            We found an old building that felt just right 
            for what we had in mind. Sure, there was a lot of work ahead - but we were determined to bring it to life.

          <h5>Milestone 3: the hard work</h5>
          <br>
          <p>
            There was a ton of work to do. First, we tackled the electrics - good music gear needs stable power, 
            especially those AMPs that love to gobble up energy. Next came the bathrooms and the cafeteria. 
            Albert was happy - finally, there was coffee at the center.

          <br>
          <p>
            That was definitely the most expensive and time-consuming part of the whole project. Which room should host 
            which instruments? Honestly - until then, we'd never really thought about how pricey music gear actually is.
            Not to mention the sound isolation, acoustic panels, paint, flooring... you name it.
            But in the end? We pulled it off - and pretty well, too.

            An unforgettable moment -almost 50 people showed up to our opening party. And not just for the barbecue and beer.
            SCHALLPLATTE is finally up and running!
